abstract = {Certified code is a general mechanism for enforcing security properties.In this paradigm, untrusted agent code carries annotations that allowa host to verify its trustworthiness. Before running the agent, thehost checks the annotations and proves that they imply the host'ssecurity policy. Despite the flexibility of this scheme, so far,compilers that generate proof-carrying code have focused on simplememory and control-flow safety rather than more general securityproperties. Security automata can enforce an expressive collectionof security policies including access control policies and resourcebounds policies. In this paper, we show how to take specificationsin the form of security automata and automatically transform theminto signatures for a typed lambda calculus that will enforce thecorresponding safety property. Moreover, we describe how to instrumenttyped source language programs with security checks and typing annotationsso that the resulting programs are provably secure and can be mechanicallychecked. This work provides a foundation for the process of certified code in a type-theoretic framework.},
